            This project has been made primarily for the convenience of the teachers of Reservoir High School in Fulton, MD of Howard County. Any suggestions/requests or even questions can be sent to myself or the Co-Creator through means of contact by the credentials in the contact page. Designed to make Gator Time easier on staff, this website comes equipped with many handy features to help you manage the halls in an efficient and effective way. The instructions are simple. Just click on the access database link to view the students already reserved for Gator Time. Included in this database is also a feature to see where that student is, as well as reserve a student. All there is to do is reserve the students you want to meet with, if you are a landing period teacher, then you can search for the students supposed to be in your class in this database. Reminder, the list of students are those who are not going to be in your landing period class. If for any reason, you intend to contact the creators, please click the contact tab. Gator Time has become a tedious task of managing wandering students, creating a waste in time and paper. The purpose of this application is to alleviate this process.
